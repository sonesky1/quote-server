# drop-in-the-bucket
An Environmental Goals Server App

To run the program:
From inside the directory "server-app" type the following:

cargo run

This will need to be run in a terminal or desktop that can redirect to localhost as this server is on the web
It is only local at this time

two boxes will appear and a button. Type your environmental goal step in box 1. In box 2 type a category
it could pertain to. You can create a category or if you see a related one appear when you start typing
you could repeat the same one

If you don't type anything and push the button you will see a response that explains this better

If you submit your response you will receive a good job comment!

Later, this will have much more functionality. Have fun with the app.
